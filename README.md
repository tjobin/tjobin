### 🔭 Featured Projects

#### ⚛️ [Neural Quantum States: KANs vs MLPs](https://github.com/tjobin/TP-IV-CQSL)
*Benchmarking Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) within a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) architecture for VMC.*
- **Method:** Implemented a custom VMC solver in **JAX/Flax**. Compared standard MLP global features against KANs for ground-state energy approximation of LiH and Li2.
- **Key Result:** While KANs showed high expressivity, the simpler Vertex/Edge MPNN ansatz converged faster for small systems, achieving chemical accuracy (1.6 mHa) with fewer fluctuations.
- **Tools:** JAX, Flax, NetKet, jaxkan.

#### 🧪 [NQS with Pseudopotentials (ccECP)](https://github.com/yourusername/netket-ecp)
*Extending Neural Quantum States to transition metals.*
- **Method:** Implemented **core-correlated Effective Core Potentials (ccECP)** to simulate 3rd-row elements (Ga, Kr, Sc, Ti) without explicitly modeling core electrons.
- **Optimization:** Utilized [**Forward Laplacian**](https://github.com/y1xiaoc/fwdlap) (via JAX) for efficient kinetic energy estimation.
- **Key Result:** Achieved chemical accuracy for Ga and Kr compared to FermiNet baselines.
- **Tools:** JAX, Flax, NetKet, Ferminet_ECP.

#### 🕰️ [Adaptive Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution (AQITE)](https://github.com/tjobin/adaptive-qite)
*Developing a dynamic time-step algorithm for ground-state preparation on NISQ devices.*
- **Method:** Designed an adaptive algorithm that adjusts the Trotter time-step $\Delta\tau$ based on the angular velocity of the state vector in Hilbert space.
- **Key Result:** The adaptive method proved **3x more robust** to initial parameter selection than standard QITE, successfully reproducing the $H_2$ Potential Energy Surface across all entanglement regimes.
- **Tools:** Qiskit.

#### ⭐️ [VQE Robustness: UCCSD vs EfficientSU2](https://github.com/tjobin/vqe)
*Analysis of ansatz performance under depolarizing noise.*
- **Method:** Simulated VQE for LiH using Qiskit's Aer Estimator with injected gate noise (depolarizing channel).
- **Key Result:** Discovered that **EfficientSU2** is significantly more robust to gate errors (up to 1% error rate) than the physically motivated UCCSD, despite UCCSD's superior theoretical convergence rate.
- **Tools:** Qiskit.

#### 🧬 **[Interpretable ML for Protein Folding](https://github.com/CS-433/ml-project-2-pebkac)**
- Modified an **AttentionDCA** model to accept physics-based molecular representations (SPAHM, SLATM).
- **Key Finding:** By analyzing attention weights, found that the model prioritizes lower electronic energy levels (SPAHM eigenvalues), aligning with physical intuition for protein stability.
